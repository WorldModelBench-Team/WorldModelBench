This repo contains the evaluation instructions for the paper "[WorldModelBench: Judging Video Generation Models As World Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mBBGM1E14JlmXmqRFonlqs76d9uBBZ0T?usp=drive_link)".

## üîîNews

- **üî•[2025-02-23]: Our [WorldModelBench](https://seerkfang.github.io/world-model-benchmark.github.io/) is now available. We look forward to your participation! üòÜ**

## Introduction

### WorldModelBench

WorldModelBencha is a benchmark designed to evaluate the **world modeling capabilities** of video generation models across **7** application-driven domains (spanning from Robotics, Driving, Industry, Human Activities, Gaming, Animation, and Natural) and **56** subdomains. Each domain features 50 carefully curated prompts, comprising a text description and an initial video frame, tailored for video generation. We provide a **human-aligned** VLM (Vision-Language Model) based judger to automatically evaluate model-generated videos on **Instruction Following**, **Common Sense**, and **Physical Adherence**.

## Evaluation

üéØ Please refer to the following instructions to evaluate with WorldModelBench:
- **Environment Setup**: Clone and install VILA by following the instructions in [VILA Installation Guide](https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
- **Data&Model Preparation**: Download [WorldModelBench test set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Efficient-Large-Model/worldmodelbench) and the [judge](https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/vila-ewm-qwen2-1.5b) separately.
```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worldmodelbench
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images (first frames of videos)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ evaluation.py (evaluation script)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worldmodelbench.json (test set)
    ...
```
The ```worldmodelbench.json``` has a list of dict containing instances for video generation.
```
[
  {
          "domain": "autonomous vehicle",
          "subdomain": "Stopping",
          "text_first_frame": "The autonomous vehicle approaches a traffic light on a bridge surrounded by tall buildings. Construction barriers line the sides of the bridge with a yellow traffic light visible ahead.",
          "text_instruction": "The autonomous vehicle stops at the traffic light on the bridge.",
          "first_frame": "images/69620089860948e38a4921dd4869d24f.jpg"
      }
...
]
```
- **Video Generation**: Perform video generation model inference. You will find 350 test instances in the worldmodelbench.json file. For *each instance*, follow the instructions below to generate the videos:
  - **Text-to-Video**: Use the following as the generation prompt: ```" ".join([instance["text_first_frame"], instance["text_instruction"]])```.
  - **Image-to-Video**: Use the following as the generation prompt: ```instance["first_frame"] + instance["text_instruction"]```.
**Note**: Please save the video using the **same name** as ```instance["first_frame"]```, replacing the file extension ```.jpg``` with ```.mp4```.
- **Evaluation**:
```
python evaluate.py --video_dir GENERATED_VIDEOS --judge PATH_TO_JUDGE --save_name RESULTS_FILE
```

The answers and explanations for the test set questions are withheld. You can [reach out](https://github.com/Seerkfang/WorldModelBenchmark#contact) to the organizers to submit your results for the leaderboard.
